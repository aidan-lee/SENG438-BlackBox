# SENG438-BlackBox
An assignment completed for the Winter 2018 offering of SENG 438 at the University of Calgary

This assignment was completed in a group of four students, and utilized black box testing techniques to design test cases.  These cases were executed to determine the functionality of classes provided by the professor, based on the functionalities detailed in the provided JavaDocs.  These JavaDocs can be found in the Assignment 2-artifact zip file, inside the "index" folder of the "JFreeChart-ModifiedJavadoc" folder.

RangeBoundsTests.java and RangeLengthTest.java were written by me.  All other classes were written by other group members.
